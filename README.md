# llama.cpp scripts

In this repo I openly store my scripts I use with [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp). The idea is to have a handy, easy-to-follow reference for those times when I need to circle back to using llama.cpp after a while.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the llama.cpp repository and build it by following its provided instructions.
2. Download the necessary ggml models.
